The application primarily consists of a React frontend. The directory structure is as follows:

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: **Importance:** Defines global styling, responsive design, and component aesthetics, including theme variables. **Changes:** Extensive modifications were made to address almost every UI/UX request.
