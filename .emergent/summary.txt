The AI engineer successfully progressed the Voltis Labs Games application through multiple development cycles. Initially, the project involved a comprehensive rebranding, UI/UX refinements, and content integration based on a detailed 10-point plan and explicit user feedback, including crucial mobile responsiveness fixes like slider padding.

Subsequent interactions, captured in this trajectory, focused on dynamic updates: adjusting the homepage slider content and count, implementing a new logo, introducing coming soon placeholders for several games with specific ordering, and revamping the merchandise page's display. A significant effort was dedicated to designing and applying a new, visually rich template for all game detail pages, replacing a previously poor design. The engineer also addressed navigation improvements (opening game pages in new tabs), social media link removal, and footer spacing. The process was iterative, involving detailed debugging and frequent screenshot verification. The latest work involved attempts to replace a specific slider image for Spellcheck, which ended in a user-requested revert due to misinterpretation and image unavailability.

The user tasked the AI engineer with evolving an existing gaming website, starting with experimental image integration and progressing to a full rebranding and UI/UX overhaul.

1.  **Initial Branding & Content Overhaul (Pre-trajectory work):** Replace placeholder images, rename Pilgrims to Spinnersonic, integrate Voltis Labs as parent company with links, rewrite About section, define initial six games, design individual game pages mirroring a reference, expand merchandise page to 48 items with a shop slider, and replace the Contact page with specific content.
2.  **Initial UI/UX Enhancements & Bug Fixes (Pre-trajectory work):** Adjust Spellcheck page background and image, eliminate overall website background, increase main slider height/reduce game count (to 3) with specific aspect ratio, remove Made with Emergent banner, implement cookie consent (show once), configure mobile footer links (2-column), ensure mobile banner images are centered, place copyright below links, remove other products from About page, and resolve mobile slider right-side padding.
3.  **Recent Enhancements (Current trajectory work):** Reduce homepage slider to 2 items (Spinnersonic, Creaks) and replace logo. Add 8 Ball Pool and Penalty Shootout. Make all game cards clickable, opening in new tabs, with a template for details and download links. Update specific game thumbnails to coming soon images, appearing *after* released games. Clean merchandise page by removing header text/subtitle, fixing split banner, and removing navigation. Remove Facebook and Bluesky links, reduce excessive footer padding. Redesign all game pages with a gaming-focused UI. Implement currency conversion from $ to £ on merchandise. Revert unintended golden/yellow text on mobile homepage. Implement light mode theme across the entire website, including a dedicated light mode logo. Add shopping cart functionality (add to cart, cart modal, checkout). Fix slider issues (broken navigation, merged images), ensure logo visibility in light mode, fix cookie consent bugs, populate the Privacy Policy page, add game selection to Customer Support - Games on the Contact Page, make slider fullscreen on mobile and taller on desktop, fix mobile navbar/logo display, implement a hamburger menu for mobile (rightmost icon), force page to fit mobile screens, and ensure all footer items (e.g., Voltis Labs) are visible on mobile.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user report about footer items not displaying correctly on mobile, specifically Voltis Labs. The investigation confirmed that the cookie consent banner was overlapping the footer content, making parts of it invisible.

The AI engineer resolved this issue by:
1.  **Modifying CSS:** Added  to the  CSS class in . This created sufficient space between the main content and the bottom of the viewport to accommodate the cookie consent banner.
2.  **Adjusting Z-Index:** Increased the  of the cookie consent banner to  to ensure it rendered above other elements, while the footer was given sufficient space.

This combination of changes ensured that all footer links, including Voltis Labs, are now fully visible and accessible on mobile devices, even when the cookie consent banner is present. The AI engineer confirmed the fix with a mobile screenshot showing the complete footer.
