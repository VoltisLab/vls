The AI engineer successfully progressed the Voltis Labs Games application through multiple development cycles. Initially, the project involved a comprehensive rebranding, UI/UX refinements, and content integration based on a detailed 10-point plan and explicit user feedback, including crucial mobile responsiveness fixes like slider padding.

Subsequent interactions, captured in this trajectory, focused on dynamic updates: adjusting the homepage slider content and count, implementing a new logo, introducing coming soon placeholders for several games with specific ordering, and revamping the merchandise page's display. A significant effort was dedicated to designing and applying a new, visually rich template for all game detail pages, replacing a previously poor design. The engineer also addressed navigation improvements (opening game pages in new tabs), social media link removal, and footer spacing. The process was iterative, involving detailed debugging and frequent screenshot verification. The latest work involved attempts to replace a specific slider image for Spellcheck, which ended in a user-requested revert due to misinterpretation and image unavailability.

The user tasked the AI engineer with evolving an existing gaming website, starting with experimental image integration and progressing to a full rebranding and UI/UX overhaul.

1.  **Initial Branding & Content Overhaul (Pre-trajectory work):** Replace placeholder images, rename Pilgrims to Spinnersonic, integrate Voltis Labs as parent company with links, rewrite About section, define initial six games (Doomlane, Spinnersonic, Triangle Chess, Tacticx, Spellcheck, Grindhouse), design individual game pages mirroring a reference, expand merchandise page to 48 items with a shop slider, and replace the Contact page with specific content.
2.  **Initial UI/UX Enhancements & Bug Fixes (Pre-trajectory work):** Adjust Spellcheck page background and image, eliminate overall website background, increase main slider height/reduce game count (to 3) with specific aspect ratio, remove Made with Emergent banner, implement cookie consent (show once), configure mobile footer links (2-column), ensure mobile banner images are centered, place copyright below links, remove other products from About page, and resolve mobile slider right-side padding for edge-to-edge display.
3.  **Recent Enhancements (Current trajectory work):**
    *   **Sliders & Logo:** Reduce homepage slider to 2 items (Spinnersonic, Creaks) and replace logo. (Later, main slider reverted to 1 item, then back to 2, and merch slider reduced to 1 item).
    *   **Game Content:** Add 8 Ball Pool and Penalty Shootout. Make all game cards clickable, opening in new tabs, using a template with a banner, description, and app store download links.
    *   **Visuals & Order:** Update Creaks, Doomlane, Tacticx, 8 Ball Pool, and Penalty Shootout thumbnails to coming soon images, appearing *after* released games on both homepage featured section and Games page.
    *   **Page Clean-up:** Remove header text and subtitle from the merchandise page. Fix the broken split banner on the merch page and remove its navigation/dots, keeping only the first item. Remove Facebook and Bluesky links. Reduce excessive footer padding.
    *   **Game Page Design:** Redesign all game pages to have a more exciting, gaming-focused UI with cool design and navigation styles.
    *   **Spellcheck Slider Revert:** Change the Spellcheck main slider banner to a black widescreen image with words falling (attempted and then reverted).

<pending_tasks>
-   **Clarify Spellcheck Slider Image:** The user requested a black widescreen image with words falling for the Spellcheck homepage slider, but the AI engineer was unable to identify the correct image from available assets and reverted the changes. This task requires user clarification or provision of the correct asset.
-   **Slider Navigation Issue (Minor):** The homepage slider's navigation (clicking dots or auto-advance) showed inconsistencies, occasionally remaining stuck on the first slide. While not a primary focus, it might require further investigation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request regarding the homepage slider image for the Spellcheck game. The user explicitly stated, The main slider on the home was a black widescreen image with words falling, not this purple one. Change it pls.

The AI engineer's actions were as follows:
1.  **Identified Current Image:** Located the  entry in  and confirmed it was using  (the blue/purple background).
2.  **Attempted Image Replacement (First Try):** Replaced the image URL for Spellcheck in the  array with , reasoning it was a dark, widescreen image.
3.  **Observed and Debugged:** Took a screenshot of the homepage. The Spellcheck image in the *featured games section* (below the slider) visually changed to SPELLCHECK text on a blue background, but the *main slider* continued to display Spinnersonic. Attempts to advance the slider (via clicking dots or waiting for auto-advance) were unsuccessful, indicating a potential underlying slider mechanics issue or a mismatch in image loading.
4.  **Attempted Image Replacement (Second Try):** Based on the user's words falling description, tried a different dark image: .
5.  **Observed Again & Asked for Clarification:** Another screenshot showed similar results: the featured games section still displayed the blue SPELLCHECK text, and the main slider remained stuck on Spinnersonic. The AI engineer then listed all available assets and asked the user to explicitly identify which image was the desired black widescreen image with words falling.
6.  **User Revert Request:** The user responded with a direct command: revert your lastchanges.
7.  **Reversion:** The AI engineer successfully reverted the Spellcheck image in  back to its original  (blue/purple background).

The current state is that the Spellcheck game in the homepage slider is using the blue/purple background image, and the user's request for a specific black widescreen image with falling words remains unfulfilled and unclarified. The underlying issue with the slider navigation (not advancing) was observed but not resolved.
